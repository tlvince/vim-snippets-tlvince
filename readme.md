# vim-snippets-tlvince

> A collection of custom Vim snippets

Exclusive supports (and therefore dependent on) the UltiSnips engine.

## Usage

Simply clone into your Pathogen-managed bundle directory. Since UltiSnips loads
any 'UltiSnips' directories in `runtimepath`, it should be a case of
plug-n-play.

Some snippets look for custom properties, such as `g:snips_author`. See
[tlvince/vim-config/.vim/after/plugin/ultisnips.vim][1] for an example.
